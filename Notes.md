# Industrial

Inspiration: RVW Lark Ascending. 
Ideas:
     Poor fundamental movement (bass).
     Weak structure.  Constant pull to dominant but only &quot;modulation&quot; is
        to subdominant and it's too weak.
     Rules are broken unintelligently. Parallels everywhere (but in RVW style).
     Vapid. Harmonic repetition with only surface movement.

# Purgatorial

Inspiration: RVW Dives and Lazarus. 
Ideas:
     Kind of a reverse of Industrial. It starts with difficult harmonic movement.
     Tonal centre has shifted but the perspective hasn't (until the end).
     Forced monotony in bass at end.
     Much more traditional structures, lines.
     Rules are broken more intelligently.

# Voices

Inspiration: RVW Dives and Lazarus. 
Ideas:
     Two voices in counterpoint.
     Long-term harmonic progress: first and second conversations make little progress 
        while setting out the ideas, but third and fourth parts push forwards and firmly
        send us back to the tonic.
        
# Pastoral

Ideas:
     This could become a corrected and improved version of the Industrial theme.
     Alternatively it could be a significantly more pastoral variant using the same tune.
     NB in either version, the opening should be the same but with movement in the bass.
